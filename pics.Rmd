### Figure 1. The risk for severe maternal morbidity (SMM) based on race, including transfusion (left) and roldugin transfusion (right) 

```{r}
sever <- PPH %>% filter(sever_morbidity == 1) 
a <- sever %>% group_by(race) %>% summarise(s = n())
b <- PPH %>% group_by(race) %>% summarise(total = n())
c <- cbind(a, b$total) %>% mutate(percentage = s/b$total)
```

### Figure 2. The risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation (A), transfusion (B), and hysterectomy (C) within a race for patients with postpartum hemorrhage.


### Figure 3. The risk for morbidity based on the median income of patientsâ€™ zipcode.
